Question:
1. With provided tables structure find  customers ( customer.name) with the latest order dates.

Solution:

with order_ as (
select max(o.order_date) latest_date, o.CUSTOMER_ID from orders o
where o.QUANTITY is not NULL
group by o.CUSTOMER_ID
order by o.CUSTOMER_ID )
select order_.latest_date, cus.name from CUSTOMERS cus, order_
where cus.CUSTOMER_ID = order_.CUSTOMER_ID

LATEST_DATE	NAME
----------------------
03-JUN-17	Comp_A
03-JUN-17	Comp_B
06-JUN-17	Comp_C
05-JUN-17	Comp_D
01-JUN-17	Comp_E


Question:
2. for each customer, show the largest absolute change in quantity between orders. Use window clause of analytical functions, disregard days with NULL orders; several orders on one day - one order; ignore change from "non customer" to "customer"

select a.name,
        a.order_day_DD,
        a.max_diff
from (
                select  ord_c.name,
                        ord_c.order_day_DD,
                        ord_c.diff_,
                        max((ord_c.diff_)) keep ( dense_rank last order by ord_c.order_day_DD ) over (partition by ord_c.name) as max_diff
                from (
                    select  
                             cust.name, 
                             (o.order_quantity_sum - LAG(o.order_quantity_sum,1) over (partition by o.customer_id order by order_day_DD) ) as diff_,
                             o.order_day_DD
                       from (
                              select o.customer_id ,trunc(o.order_date,'DD') as order_day_DD, sum(o.quantity) as order_quantity_sum 
                                from orders o
                                    where o.QUANTITY is not null
                                    group by o.customer_id, trunc(o.order_date,'DD')
                                    order by o.customer_id
                            ) o, customers cust
                        where o.customer_id = cust.customer_id
                    ) ord_c            
                where ord_c.diff_ is not null
                ) a
where a.diff_ = a.max_diff
order by name
